# HTML-Scraper
A simple HTML Scraper in C# using Windows Forms

This code is based on the tutorial at https://dev.to/rachelsoderberg/create-a-simple-web-scraper-in-c-1l1m, and scrapes from articles at Ocean Networks Canada. The user enters search terms, and is given corresponding article names and links.

Besides following along from scratch, I've added a search box to allow custom search terms without needing to refactor the code, and some other functions, along with helpful comments.

<h2>Features and Skills Demonstrated</h2>

<ul><li>Windows Forms manipulation</li><li>HTML document parsing</li><li>Asynchronous HTML code scraping</li><li>Search box allowing multiple terms separated by commas</li><li>Advanced string manipulation</li></ul>
