# HTML-Scraper
A simple HTML Scraper in C# using Windows Forms

This code is based on the tutorial at https://dev.to/rachelsoderberg/create-a-simple-web-scraper-in-c-1l1m, and scrapes from articles at Ocean Networks Canada.

Besides following along from scratch, I've added a search box to allow custom search terms without needing to refactor the code, and some other functions, along with helpful comments.
